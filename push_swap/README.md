### push_swap
- Simple sorting algorithm that sorts stack_a using a predefined set of instructions and a spare stack_b.
- Takes in input and prints the operations needed for sorting to stdin.

#### Valid input
- Input is considered valid when all input is digits, they are within the range of an integer and input contains no duplicates.
`./push_swap 0 1 2 3, ./push_swap "0 1 2 3, ./push_swap "0 1" 2 "3"`
- Also includes a checker that takes in values as parameter and listens to stdin for instructions, and checks if instructions were correct.
